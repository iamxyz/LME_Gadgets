## ddm_mistakes_analyst
### The program will help you to get report on your mistakes in DDM assignment. It runs on RStudio and R, before you get it started, you should make a RMD file using the source code in the ddm_mistakes_analyst. The analyst will get the data you input in the RMD file and generate a report for you automatically. You could get to know your weak points in DDM and improve them by perfect practice later. ^_^

To all LME students, currently the ddm mistakes analyst is only a prototype. In order to use it, you should download and install the R software developement tools on your computer, the R and RStudio. Then make a RMD file in the RStudio, using the source code and input required data into the file which depend on you own answers in the DDM assignment. After you finish it, use the knit function in the RStudio to get your own report as a PDF, MS Word or HTML file.
